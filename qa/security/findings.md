# Security & Compliance Snapshot

## Executive Summary
**Status: GOOD with WARNINGS** - Security architecture is well-designed but has implementation issues.

## Key Findings

### 1. Secrets Management ✅
- **Good**: No hardcoded secrets in application code
- **Good**: Using AWS Secrets Manager and KMS for encryption
- **WARNING**: `test.env` file contains hardcoded password: `postgresql://test-user:password@localhost:5432/telehealth_test`
- **Good**: Comprehensive PHI redactor implemented

### 2. Transport Security ✅
- **Good**: Helmet.js configured for security headers
- **Good**: TLS 1.2+ enforced in infrastructure (Terraform)
- **Good**: HSTS enabled through Helmet
- **Good**: Secure cookies configuration present

### 3. CORS Strategy ✅
- **Good**: Environment-driven CORS configuration
- **Good**: Origin validation service with allow-list
- **Good**: Credentials and methods properly restricted
- **Good**: WebSocket CORS properly configured

### 4. Authentication/Authorization ✅
- **Good**: AWS Cognito integration for authentication
- **Good**: JWT with KMS signing for video visits
- **Good**: RBAC/ABAC middleware implemented
- **Good**: Session management with refresh tokens

### 5. PHI Handling ⭐ EXCELLENT
- **Excellent**: Comprehensive PHI redactor (`phi-redactor.ts`)
  - Email, phone, SSN, tracking number redaction
  - Context-aware redaction (patient/medical)
  - Tokenization for correlation
  - Pino logger integration
- **Good**: No PHI in logs, traces, or analytics
- **Good**: Field-level encryption for sensitive data

### 6. Audit Trails ⭐ EXCELLENT
- **Excellent**: Comprehensive audit service implementation
  - All PHI access logged with purpose of use
  - Before/after state capture
  - Suspicious activity detection
  - Immutable audit logs in database
  - CSV export capability
  - 7-year retention policy (2555 days)
- **Good**: Real-time alerting on suspicious activities

### 7. Encryption at Rest ✅
- **Good**: KMS encryption for all data stores:
  - RDS (PostgreSQL) encrypted
  - S3 buckets with SSE-KMS
  - DynamoDB with KMS encryption
  - Redis/ElastiCache encryption
  - Video recordings with dedicated KMS key
- **Good**: Key rotation enabled

### 8. SAST/DAST Readiness ⚠️
- **Good**: TypeScript strict mode attempted
- **WARNING**: No automated SAST tools configured
- **WARNING**: No dependency scanning in CI/CD
- **WARNING**: Multiple security vulnerabilities in dependencies

### 9. Infrastructure Security ✅
- **Good**: WAF configurations present (optional)
- **Good**: VPC with private subnets for RDS
- **Good**: Security groups properly configured
- **Good**: IAM roles with least privilege
- **Good**: S3 bucket policies require TLS

### 10. Compliance Services ✅
- **Good**: HIPAA compliance service implemented
- **Good**: SOC2 compliance service implemented
- **Good**: Security audit service with automated checks

## Critical Issues

1. **Merge Conflict** (P0): `notification.gateway.ts:59` contains merge conflict marker
2. **TypeScript Errors** (P0): Prevent deployment and security scanning
3. **Dependency Vulnerabilities** (P0): 11 vulnerabilities including 1 critical in Next.js
4. **Test Environment Credentials** (P1): Hardcoded password in test.env

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0)
1. Resolve merge conflict in notification.gateway.ts
2. Update Next.js to >=14.2.32 to fix critical auth bypass
3. Fix TypeScript compilation errors
4. Remove hardcoded credentials from test.env

### High Priority (P1)
1. Implement automated SAST scanning (Semgrep, SonarQube)
2. Add dependency scanning to CI/CD pipeline
3. Configure ESLint with security rules
4. Implement secret scanning in pre-commit hooks

### Medium Priority (P2)
1. Enable AWS Shield for DDoS protection
2. Implement API key rotation policy
3. Add security headers testing
4. Create security runbooks

## Compliance Posture

### HIPAA Technical Safeguards
- ✅ Access Control (§164.312(a))
- ✅ Audit Controls (§164.312(b))
- ✅ Integrity Controls (§164.312(c))
- ✅ Transmission Security (§164.312(e))

### SOC 2 Controls
- ✅ CC6.1: Logical and Physical Access Controls
- ✅ CC7.2: System Monitoring
- ✅ CC6.7: Transmission of Sensitive Information
- ⚠️ CC7.1: Vulnerability Management (needs improvement)

## Security Architecture Strengths
1. Defense in depth with multiple layers
2. Comprehensive audit logging
3. Excellent PHI handling and redaction
4. Strong encryption implementation
5. Well-designed ABAC/RBAC system
