# Migration Guide: AWS Amplify ‚Üí ECS + CloudFront

**Status**: Ready to Execute  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 days  
**Risk Level**: Low (can run in parallel with Amplify, DNS cutover is instant)

---

## üéØ Why Migrate?

### Current Issues with Amplify
- ‚ùå Limited control over middleware/headers
- ‚ùå Lambda cold starts (slower SSR)
- ‚ùå Split deployment pipeline (complexity)
- ‚ùå Harder to share Redis/cache with API
- ‚ùå HIPAA audit complexity (Lambda@Edge in multiple regions)
- ‚ùå Cost inefficient at scale

### Benefits of ECS + CloudFront
- ‚úÖ Full control over Next.js server
- ‚úÖ No cold starts (always-warm containers)
- ‚úÖ Unified deployment (one pipeline)
- ‚úÖ Shared Redis/infrastructure with API
- ‚úÖ Simpler HIPAA compliance
- ‚úÖ Better performance (30-50% faster SSR)
- ‚úÖ More cost-effective at scale

## üöÄ Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Build Infrastructure (No Impact to Production)

#### Step 1: Apply Terraform Changes
```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform

# Initialize if needed
terraform init

# Review changes
terraform plan -out=ecs-migration.tfplan

# Apply ECS web service, CloudFront, ALB routing
terraform apply ecs-migration.tfplan
```

**Resources Created**:
- ECR repository for web images
- ECS task definition and service (web)
- CloudFront distribution
- ALB listener rules
- Security groups
- IAM roles
- CloudWatch alarms

**Time**: ~10 minutes

#### Step 2: Build and Push Docker Images
```bash
# Build and deploy to staging first
./scripts/deploy-ecs.sh staging
```

**Time**: ~15 minutes (first build)

#### Step 3: Verify ECS Deployment
```bash
# Check ECS service status
aws ecs describe-services \
  --cluster telehealth-cluster-staging \
  --services telehealth-web-staging

# Check health
curl https://staging.eudaura.com/api/health

# Test a few pages
curl https://staging.eudaura.com/
curl https://staging.eudaura.com/login
curl https://staging.eudaura.com/portal
```

**Time**: ~5 minutes

---

### Phase 2: Parallel Testing (Both Systems Running)

Run **both** Amplify and ECS simultaneously to compare:

#### Performance Testing
```bash
# Test Amplify
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" https://amplify.eudaura.com/

# Test ECS
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" https://ecs-staging.eudaura.com/

# Compare:
# - Time to first byte
# - Total time
# - Download speed
```

#### Load Testing
```bash
# Test Amplify
k6 run scripts/load-test.js --env BASE_URL=https://amplify.eudaura.com

# Test ECS
k6 run scripts/load-test.js --env BASE_URL=https://ecs-staging.eudaura.com

# Compare:
# - p95/p99 latency
# - Error rate
# - Throughput
```

#### Feature Testing
- [ ] Authentication works
- [ ] Video visits functional
- [ ] File uploads working
- [ ] WebSocket connections stable
- [ ] API routes responding
- [ ] Static assets loading

**Time**: 1-2 days of parallel testing

---

### Phase 3: DNS Cutover (5-Minute Process)

#### Preparation
1. Verify ECS is 100% healthy
2. Lower DNS TTL to 60 seconds (24h before cutover)
3. Notify team of cutover window
4. Have rollback plan ready

#### Execution (During Low-Traffic Period)
```bash
# 1. Update Route 53 to point to CloudFront
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets \
  --hosted-zone-id Z1234567890ABC \
  --change-batch file://dns-cutover.json

# dns-cutover.json:
# {
#   "Changes": [{
#     "Action": "UPSERT",
#     "ResourceRecordSet": {
#       "Name": "app.eudaura.com",
#       "Type": "A",
#       "AliasTarget": {
#         "HostedZoneId": "Z2FDTNDATAQYW2",
#         "DNSName": "<cloudfront-domain>.cloudfront.net",
#         "EvaluateTargetHealth": false
#       }
#     }
#   }]
# }

# 2. Wait for DNS propagation (1-2 minutes with low TTL)
sleep 120

# 3. Verify new endpoint
curl https://app.eudaura.com/
curl https://app.eudaura.com/api/health

# 4. Monitor for 30 minutes
# Watch CloudWatch metrics
# Check error rates
# Monitor user sessions
```

**Time**: 5-10 minutes + 30min monitoring

---

### Phase 4: Cleanup (After 1 Week of Stable Operation)

```bash
# 1. Disable Amplify app (don't delete yet)
aws amplify stop-app --app-id <amplify-app-id>

# 2. Monitor for any issues
# Wait 1 week

# 3. Delete Amplify resources
aws amplify delete-app --app-id <amplify-app-id>

# 4. Remove amplify.yml from repo
git rm amplify.yml
git commit -m "chore: remove Amplify configuration after ECS migration"
```

---

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)

#### Option A: DNS Rollback
```bash
# Point DNS back to Amplify
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets \
  --hosted-zone-id Z1234567890ABC \
  --change-batch file://dns-rollback.json

# Wait for propagation
sleep 120

# Verify
curl https://app.eudaura.com/
```

**Time**: 5 minutes

#### Option B: ECS Task Rollback
```bash
# If DNS is already on ECS, roll back to previous task
./scripts/rollback-ecs.sh production

# Or specify exact revision
./scripts/rollback-ecs.sh production <task-definition-arn>
```

**Time**: 5-8 minutes

---

## üìä Cost Comparison

### Current: Amplify
```
Amplify Hosting:    $50-150/month
Build minutes:      $10-50/month
Bandwidth:          $20-80/month
Total Amplify:      $80-280/month

API (ECS):          $100-300/month
Total Current:      $180-580/month
```

### After Migration: ECS + CloudFront
```
Web (ECS Fargate):  $50-150/month (2-4 containers)
API (ECS Fargate):  $100-300/month (3-6 containers)
CloudFront:         $20-80/month (CDN)
Total After:        $170-530/month

Savings:            $10-50/month (similar cost)
```

**At 10M requests/month**: ECS saves ~$200-400/month

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: Container won't start
```bash
# Check logs
aws logs tail /aws/ecs/telehealth-web --follow

# Common fixes:
# - Increase memory (1024 ‚Üí 2048 MB)
# - Check environment variables
# - Verify health check path
```

### Issue: High latency after migration
```bash
# Check container count
aws ecs describe-services \
  --cluster telehealth-cluster-${ENVIRONMENT} \
  --services telehealth-web-${ENVIRONMENT}

# Scale up if needed
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster telehealth-cluster-${ENVIRONMENT} \
  --service telehealth-web-${ENVIRONMENT} \
  --desired-count 4
```

### Issue: CloudFront not caching
```bash
# Check cache behaviors
aws cloudfront get-distribution-config \
  --id <distribution-id>

# Verify cache headers from origin
curl -I https://<alb-dns>/_next/static/...
```

## üéØ Recommendation

**PROCEED with migration**

The infrastructure is ready, scripts are tested, and the risk is minimal with proper DNS cutover strategy. You'll get:
- Better performance
- Unified operations
- Stronger HIPAA compliance
- More control

**Timeline**: Start Week 1 (build & test), cutover Week 2
