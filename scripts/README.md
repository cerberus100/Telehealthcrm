# Or change DNS back to Amplify (if needed)
# Edit Route 53 manually or use prepared changeset
```

### Monitor Deployment
```bash
# Watch API logs
aws logs tail /aws/ecs/telehealth-api --follow

# Watch Web logs
aws logs tail /aws/ecs/telehealth-web --follow

# Check service status

## üìä Deployment Comparison

| Feature | Amplify | ECS (New) |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Deploy command** | `git push` | `./scripts/deploy-ecs.sh` |
| **Build time** | 10-15 min | 8-12 min |
| **Rollback** | Via console | `./scripts/rollback-ecs.sh` |
| **Logs** | Amplify console | CloudWatch Logs |
| **Monitoring** | Split | Unified |
| **Cost** | $$$ | $$ |
| **Control** | Limited | Full |

## üéØ Recommended Workflow

### Development
```bash
# Local development (no Docker needed)
pnpm dev

# Test Docker build locally
./scripts/build-web-image.sh development
docker run -p 3000:3000 telehealth-web:latest
```

### Staging
```bash
# Deploy after PR merge
./scripts/deploy-ecs.sh staging

# Verify
curl https://staging.eudaura.com/api/health

# Run E2E tests
pnpm run test:e2e
```

### Production
```bash
# Deploy (requires approval)
./scripts/deploy-ecs.sh production

# Monitor for 30 minutes
# Check CloudWatch dashboard

# If issues:
./scripts/rollback-ecs.sh production
```
