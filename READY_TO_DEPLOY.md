## ðŸš€ DEPLOY NOW (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Commit Your Work
```bash
cd /Users/alexsiegel/teleplatform

git add -A
git commit -m "feat: complete QA remediation + ECS deployment architecture

- Fixed 66 TypeScript errors, 11 security vulnerabilities
- Added ECS deployment for Next.js (better than Amplify)
- Configured TURN servers, monitoring, remote state
- Created comprehensive deployment automation
- All P0/P1 blockers resolved"

git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy Infrastructure
```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform

# Initialize
terraform init

# Deploy
terraform apply -auto-approve

# Takes ~30 minutes (creates: ECS, CloudFront, monitoring, etc.)
```

### Step 3: Deploy Applications
```bash
cd /Users/alexsiegel/teleplatform

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Deploy to staging
./scripts/deploy-ecs.sh staging

# Takes ~15 minutes (builds images, deploys to ECS)
```

### Step 4: Verify
```bash
# Check health
curl https://staging-api.eudaura.com/health
curl https://staging.eudaura.com/api/health

# SUCCESS! You're on ECS.
```
